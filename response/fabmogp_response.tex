\maketitle

We thank the referees for their helpful comments on the manuscript. Below
we address their points and how we have improved the manuscript based on
their suggestions.

\section{Referee 1}

This is a well written and interesting paper on the important issue of uncertainty quantification.

The only minor changes that I request are:

On the title page, the abstract has ``an an'' -- one ``an'' should be enough.

Around line 52 of page 10, "FabSim3 is an toolkit" -- ``an'' should be ``a''.

We have corrected these typographical errors in the manuscript.

\section{Referee 2}

This is a nice and well-written paper about uncertainty quantification and calibration for an earthquake computational model. I can recommend it for publication provided the following points are addressed in the paper.

1. The authors give a bit of a mixed message about what the main aim of the paper is. Do they view it primarily as a tutorial/demonstration paper, or as a research paper containing new research results? This should be made clear in the introduction section.

2. In the paper history matching is used as an approach to calibration. Can the authors indicate how history matching relates to Bayesian model calibration?

3. Is there a literature reference for the mogp\_emulator library? I see where the software can be downloaded from Github, but is there also e.g. a journal or conference paper about it?

4. The mogp\_emulator is for "Multi Output" GPs, but am I correct that in this paper only single (i.e., scalar) outputs are considered? The summary on section 2(b) also seems to focus on GPs for scalar output.

5. Section 3(b): it is mentioned that the fault profile is created with random phases. How sensitive are the results to the details of the fault profile? Did the authors try out profiles with different phases?

6. There is no discussion or consideration of the quality of the fit of the GP surrogate model. This issue should really be addressed in the paper. Can the authors show any validation results, e.g. using cross-validation? Does the mogp\_emulator library have capabilities for such a validation, and can it be made part of the computational workflow with the tools used in this paper?

7. Can the authors comment on how their approach and workflow will scale to larger problems? In the paper, three input parameters and a single simulator output variable are used, as well as 20 sample points for fitting the GP surrogate model. How easy will it be to tackle problems with more inputs, multiple outputs, or more sample points? What will be the main bottleneck for scaling up?
